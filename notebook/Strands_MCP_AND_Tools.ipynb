    "In this notebook, we'll explore the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) in depth and learn how to leverage it effectively with the Strands Agent Framework. MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs). It enables communication between the system and locally running MCP servers that provide additional tools and resources to extend the capabilities of LLMs.\n"

    "## Understanding MCP Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The MCP architecture consists of several key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **MCP Hosts**: are programs like your Strands agents that want to access data \n",
    "2. **MCP Client**: The component that sends requests to MCP servers. In our case, this is integrated into the Strands Agent Framework.\n",
    "3. **MCP Server**: A service that provides tools and context to LLMs through a standardized API.\n",
    "4. **MCP Tools**: Specific functionalities exposed by the MCP server that the LLM can use.\n",
    "5. **Context**: The information provided to the LLM to help it understand how to use the tools.\n",

    "- [Streamable HTTP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http) : this replaces the HTTP+SSE transport from previous protocol version. In the Streamable HTTP transport, the server operates as an independent process that can handle multiple client connections. This transport uses HTTP POST and GET requests. Server can optionally make use of Server-Sent Events (SSE) to stream multiple server messages. This permits basic MCP servers, as well as more feature-rich servers supporting streaming and server-to-client notifications and requests.\n",
